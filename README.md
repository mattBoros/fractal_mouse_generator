# fractal_mouse_generator
Move your mouse to generate different fractals.

A fractal in the Julia Set can be defined with a function and a complex number. This program uses the XY coordinates of your mouse as the complex number and a predefined function to generate fractals as you move your mouse.
The program first shows you an approximation of the fractal at your mouse position while creating the exact fractal image in the background. After a second, the exact fractal will be displayed.

Below are some examples.

# How to Run
-Make sure Python 3, PyGame, and Java are installed

-Run Screen.py. The program will take a moment to load images, and then start
